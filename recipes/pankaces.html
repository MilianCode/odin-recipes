    <h1>Pancakes</h1>

    <h4>This homemade pancake recipe, adapted from 
        The New York Times Cookbook by Craig Claiborne, 
        has been a beloved staple in my kitchen since my 
        kids were little, and for good reason. Made with 
        ingredients I always have hand — like flour, baking 
        powder, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, and butter — the 
        pancakes have the perfect texture: fluffy on the 
        inside and crispy on the outside. </h4>
